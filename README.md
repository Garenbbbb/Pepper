Pepper is a revolutionary dating app tailored exclusively for pets, designed to foster connections between furry companions and their owners. The app's primary goal is to facilitate playful interactions and meaningful relationships among pets in local communities. 

Pepper features three main tabs: Discover, Message, and Profile. In the Discover tab, users can explore profiles of nearby pets, complete with photos, descriptions, and even sound clips, allowing them to express their unique personalities. Users can swipe to like or pass on profiles, initiating potential matches. When two pets mutually like each other, they unlock the ability to chat in the Message tab, enabling owners to arrange meet-ups or simply engage in friendly banter. Additionally, users can customize and manage their pets' profiles in the Profile tab, ensuring their furry friends showcase their best attributes.

 Implementation will involve developing an intuitive user interface for seamless navigation across the app's features, integrating three tab views that function differently. In the Discover tab, users can browse through profiles of other pets simply by clicking on their photos. When two pets express mutual interest, a match view appears, seamlessly transitioning the matched pet into the Message tab for further interaction. Here, users can engage in lively chats with their newfound connections. The Profile Tab offers a personalized space where users can view and edit their own pet's profile, ensuring it accurately reflects their furry friend's unique personality and traits.
